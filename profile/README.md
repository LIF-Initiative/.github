## What is LIF? 
The Learner Information Framework (LIF) is a set of open-source tools and a shared data model that work with your existing systems to find, translate, and package learner information into a consistent format. It allows applications—such as learner wallets, advising tools, or AI agents—to access richer, standardized learner context without requiring custom integrations from every system.
